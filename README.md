# ✈️ Dano Airlines Satisfaction Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains my **Data Analyst Bootcamp Capstone Project**.  

**Business Problem:**  
Dano Airlines (UK-based) faced a drop in customer satisfaction, falling below **50%** for the first time. Leadership needed **data-driven insights** to identify problem areas and improve customer experience.  

**My Solution:**  
I built an **interactive one-page dashboard in Power BI** (no DAX — only Power Query and implicit measures) that highlights customer segments, travel patterns, and service factors impacting satisfaction.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights  
- **KPIs:** Overall Satisfaction %, Total Passengers, % Loyal Customers  
- **Segmentation:** by Class, Travel Type, Customer Type, Gender, Trip Length  
- **Delay Impact:** How punctuality affects satisfaction  
- **Factor Ratings:** Cleanliness, Seat Comfort, Wi-Fi, Food & Drink, etc.  
- **Slicers:** Interactive filtering for deeper exploration

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- ✈️ **Economy long-haul passengers** reported the **lowest satisfaction**.  
- ⏱️ **Flight delays** significantly reduce satisfaction.  
- 💺 **Seat comfort** and **Wi-Fi service** were the weakest-rated factors.  
- 🤝 **Loyal customers** are more forgiving compared to first-time travelers.
